Yancheng Huang
======
I'm a Ph.D. student in the [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/team/)  at Michigan State University, guided by [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/).
Before that, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from Tongji University, where I was advised by [Prof. Kai Yang](https://kaiyangcn.github.io/), and my B.S. from Hohai University. 

During my master's studies, my research focused on the intersection of sequential data analysis and optimization. In particular, I worked on developing change point detection algorithms with theoretical guarantees for engineering problems arising from real-world applications.
Currently, I am conducting research in the area of machine unlearning.
You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
